0.4.1
* More context/filter options.
* Repeated phrase filter now handles cases where phrase is being extended by a couple characters each time (123412345123456, etc). Extension filters no longer really needed, unless the repeat starts out too short.
* Line break options added.
* Option to handle eternally looping text.
* Option to ignore text without any Japanese characters.
* Text which substitution rules reduce to nothing no longer overwrites translated text.
* Log length limit added.
* Options to manage default internal text hooks added.
* Clipboard treated as a context. Its default settings should mirror the old handling.

0.4.0
* Added it's own text hooking engine. Probably still buggy.
* Fixed excessive redrawing when a hidden furigana window had clipboard translation enabled.
* Works with new, even more poorly formatted edict files.
* Handles EUC_JP characters that Windows does not (Doesn't use them properly with WWWJDIC at the moment, however). Only really fixes loading edict files with those characters.
* Fixed right clicking when full screen.
* Fixed not checking auto Hiragana mode.
* Less picky when reading MeCab output.


0.3.5
* JParser now has an option to use mecab to aid in word detection.
* Mecab now hooked up to JParser popup definitions.
* Auto to hiragana option added. When a string contains no Japanese characters, will automatically convert to hiragana before translating, when enabled and source language is Japanese. Disabled by default.
* Minimal plugin support added. Will only add to it if there's any demand for/interest in it.
* Now supports compressed dictionaries. To use them, just stick edict2.gz or similar in the dictionaries directory.
* A couple to/from hex functions added to right click menu. Mostly useful when searching binary files with hex editors and the like.
* Option to disable substitutions added.
* Default translation direction now from Japanese to English.
* Config dialog layout fixed.
* Fixed JParser configuration flags corruption bug.

0.3.4
* Added a couple options to hide and reformat JParser tooltips, most of which were at Setsumi's suggestion.
* Added a hotkey for substitution menu.
* Added logging option to injection menu.
* JParser now breaks untranslated words at spaces (Mecab still does not).
* Use kana color for dictionary entries without any Kanji text.
* Use kanji color for full-width ASCII text used in some dictionary entries.
* Fixed mysteriously disappearing * profile.
* Fixed JParser tooltip coloring of parens.
* Fixed code for displaying definitions on own line in JParser.
* Fixed bug that would remove leading/trailing spaces from the clipboard when copying text.

0.3.3
* Substitution dialog updated. Clear and delete buttons added, profile sort order changed, initial selection choice changed. Number of lines for each profile also displayed, though currently only updated when entering the dialog.
* Fix for words with both common and uncommon spellings. May improve JParser results.
* Proper names prefixed with "(proper name)" in JParser, and names appear at bottom of list.
* JParser dictionary format changed. Dictionaries should now be about 10-15% smaller.
* JParser no longer puts "Furigana" above Japanese centered dot separators.
* Japanese repeat marker now recognized as Kanji. Affects auto-clipboard detection, but that's about it.
* Save to/from languages as strings, rather than integers. More robust against future language additions, though will lose your setting when upgrading to 0.3.3.
* Cut/copy/paste/etc removed from furigana subwindows' right-click menu.
* Minor memory leak when adding substitution lines fixed.
* Added support for FreeTranslations English to Japanese and German to English (?) options. Don't plan to add any more, those just happen to use the same server as Japanese to English.

0.3.2
* Can select from/to languages (Probably buggy).
* Added convert to romaji to right click menu (Hiragana/Katakana only).
* Fixed adding duplicate strings to substitution list.
* Fixed font color not working.
* Fixed not populating strikout/underline settings of font selection dialog.
* Fixed minor bug with a couple very rare characters in hiragana/katakana conversion.

0.3.1
* Fixed crash on some systems when going to the subsitutions config page when no substitutions have been created.
* Fixed reordering RGB color data in JParser/Mecab config screens.
* Fix for loading JParser words with furigana highlight color.
* No longer color delimiters around Hiragana characters in tooltip display.
* Changed default tooltip Kanji color slightly.
* Fixed tooltip parentheses coloring bug.
* Improved tooltip wordwrap algorithm (Now break after most punctuation).
* Added enamdict support. Any dictionary that starts with "enam" is now heavily filtered. Only exact Katakana matches surrounded by non-katakana characters are allowed from such dictionaries. enamdict worked before, but would give so many hits to every imaginable character combination as to swamp out everything else.
* Fixed updating clipboard chain when quitting through menu or via keyboard shortcut.


0.3.0
* Works with the bizarrely modified edict format.
* Configurable tooltip colors added for Jparser. Note that the idea and coloring scheme come from Setsumi.
* Can set per-game pre-translation substitutions. Must set up a launch profile for a game first. Which substitutions are used is determined by what games are running. Will use all strings for all running games and the default one (*). Note that it doesn't affect menu translations.
* Fixed clipboard bug on close. Line to restore clipboard chain was never reached.
* Fixed a bug with escape sequences in substitutions.
* No longer have to have menu translation enabled for DCBS hack to work.
* Added handling of new format for long google results.
* Fixed a bug where code to remove "potential potential" conjugations could cause crashes.
